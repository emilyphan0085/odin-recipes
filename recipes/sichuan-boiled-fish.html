            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ tsp. freshly ground white pepper (optional)</li>

            <li>½ cup bean sprouts</li>
            <li>⅓ cup dried Sichuan chiles (about 32) or other red Chinese chiles, divided</li>
            <li>7 garlic cloves, 6 smashed, coarsely chopped, 1 finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 3" piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced (about 5 slices)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. whole Sichuan peppercorns, divided</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp. doubanjiang (Sichuan-style fermented chili bean paste)</li>
            <li>2½ cups fish stock, low-sodium chicken broth, or water</li>
            <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced on a diagonal</li>
            <li>2 sprigs cilantro, sliced into 2" pieces (stems and leaves)</li>
            <li>2 tsp. gochugaru (fine Korean red pepper powder)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk egg white, wine, cornstarch, grated ginger, salt, white pepper (if using), and 1 tsp. ground Sichuan peppercorns in a medium bowl. Thinly slice fish fillets on a diagonal into ¼" slices and place in bowl with marinade. Toss to coat and let sit 30 minutes while you make the broth.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large wok or deep-sided skillet over medium-high. Add celery and bean sprouts and stir-fry, stirring constantly, until crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large deep bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove seeds from 6 dried chiles and cut crosswise into ¼" pieces. Pour 1 Tbsp. oil into same wok and heat over medium-high. Add coarsely chopped garlic, sliced ginger, sliced dried chiles, 6 whole dried chiles, 1 tsp. whole Sichuan peppercorns and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add bean paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour in stock and add remaining 1 tsp. ground Sichuan peppercorns. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover wok (use a baking sheet if you don’t have a lid), and simmer 15 minutes to infuse broth with flavor.</li>
            <li>Using your hands, lift fish out of marinade, shaking to remove excess, and transfer to hot broth; discard marinade. Cook over medium-low until just opaque, about 2 minutes. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer fish to bowl with celery and bean sprouts, arranging on top; carefully pour broth over. Top with scallions and cilantro.</li>
            <li>Wipe out wok, pour in remaining 4 Tbsp. oil, and heat over high until just smoking. Add finely chopped garlic, gochugaru, sesame seeds, remaining 20 chiles, and remaining 1 tsp. whole Sichuan peppercorns and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Immediately pour over top of fish.</li>
        </ol>
